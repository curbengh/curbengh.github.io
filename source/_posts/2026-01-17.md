title: Extending LVM partition after disk expansion
date: 2026-01-17
---

1. Boot GParted Live as this is best done offline.
2. GParted may prompt to fix the GPT header due to metadata mismatch about the disk size, select "Fix".
3. Using GParted program, deactivate the LVM partition.
4. Resize the LVM partition by dragging the right-arrow to the end.
5. Click tick ✓ to apply. Resizing should take only a few seconds, if it's not finished within a minute, reboot GParted Live and repeat; this may happen if Steps 2-3 are skipped.
6. Launch Terminal,

```
sudo -s
vgs
lvs
```

7. `vgs` may show non-zero VFree value meaning the volume group contains unallocated space. `lvs` lists the volume group and logical volume, the values are used in `lvresize`; Ubuntu defaults to `ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv`, the slash is not an _OR_, both values with a slash are required.

```
lvresize -l +100%FREE --resizefs VG-name/LV-name
vgs
```

8. `vgs` should now show zero VFree value.
9. In GParted program, activate the LVM partition.
10. Reboot.
