title: Do not disable Android lockscreen

Disabling the Android lockscreen may cause the display to turn on by itself, either after timeout or power button. Worse, after turning on, it may stay on and does not timeout. I experienced this issue in LineageOS 21 and 22. Apparently, this issue has been around since [17](https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/k2p71n/screen_keeps_turning_on/) and another one reported with version [20](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/5970).
