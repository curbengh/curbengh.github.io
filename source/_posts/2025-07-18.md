Arch Linux [linux-firmware](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/linux-firmware/) is now a meta package. Its derivative Manjaro renamed it to linux-firmware-meta. The default set covers a wide range of firmwares that may not be applicable to most devices and can be trimmed down.

1. Remove the meta package, `pacman -Rn linux-firmware`
2. Identify device manufacturer, `lspci`
3. Remove irrelevant firmware, e.g. if Nvidia device is not installed, `pacman -Rns linux-firmware-nvidia`
4. Mark the necessary firmware as explicitly installed, `pacman -D --asexplicit $(pacman -Qs -q linux-firmware | sed -z 's|\n| |g')`
   - This is necessary to avoid removing them when [removing orphans](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_(orphans)>).
