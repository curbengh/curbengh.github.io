title: Using vector tiles on Nextcloud Maps

Nextcloud Maps uses raster tiles by default, but it also supports [vector tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles) which looks nicer. Navigate to Nextcloud administration > Additional settings (`<nextcloud-domain>/settings/admin/additional`) > Maplibre settings. Set the style url as `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty`.

The style url can be set to other [map providers](https://github.com/maplibre/awesome-maplibre#maptile-providers). I use [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) because it's free and doesn't need an API key. It's available in [4 styles](https://openfreemap.org/quick_start/).

Maplibre uses WebGL to render the vector tiles, so if your browser block WebGL by default, your Nextcloud domain (not `openfreemap.org`) needs to be allowlisted for it.
