Splunk Cloud Monitoring Console (CMC) app which auto-update itself separately from Splunk Cloud recently switched from "summary" to "\_cmc_summary" index in [3.37.0 update](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/9.3.2411/ReleaseNotes/CloudMonitoringConsole) released on 27 March 2025. The update broke my custom license monitoring dashboards and alert. Resolved the issue by including the new index.
