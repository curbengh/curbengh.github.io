title: Importing intermediate certificate into Chromium/Cromite

Some websites [only serve](https://incomplete-chain.badssl.com/) leaf/server certificate instead of the usual certificate chain (leaf + intermediate). If a browser doesn't have the corresponding intermediate certificate (that signs the leaf certificate) cached beforehand, this can cause certificate error.

To download the missing intermediate certificate, click on "Not secure" > "Certificate details" > Details tab > "Authority Information Access", there should be a link next to "CA Issuers".

The easiest way is to import the downloaded certificate in Chromium/[Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) is to use the built-in Certificate Manager (`chrome://certificate-manager/localcerts/usercerts`). If you use [p11-kit](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:Grawity/Adding_a_trusted_CA_certificate#System-wide_%E2%80%93_Arch,_Fedora_(p11-kit)>) (`trust anchor --store interCA.crt`) to import, Cromite may not necessarily trust it; in that case, in Certificate Manager (`chrome://certificate-manager/localcerts`), enable "Use imported local certificates...".
