title: GnuPG 2.5 for Windows is now 64-bit only

After updating GnuPG to 2.5.16 using Chocolatey, I wasn't able to sign commit in WSL with pinentry error. The "$HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf" was previously configured with `pinentry-program "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/gnupg/bin/pinentry-basic.exe"` which is now an invalid path. I updated it to:

`pinentry-program "/mnt/c/Program Files/GnuPG/bin/pinentry-basic.exe"`

Then run `systemctl --user restart gpg-agent.service`.

If Git and GnuPG are used in Windows, the gpg config in "$HOME\\.gitconfig" should be updated to:

```
[gpg]
  program = C:\\Program Files\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe
```
