title: Opera's built-in adblocker does not support strict blocking

Unlike [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/Strict-blocking), when using `||example.com^` filter in the Opera's built-in adblocker, it does not block the webpage itself, instead only the secondary resources (e.g. `example.com/script.js`). This limitation also notably presents in [Adblock Plus](https://forum.adblockplus.org/viewtopic.php?t=18774#p85439).
